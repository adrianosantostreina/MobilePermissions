# MobilePermissions
This is a component to turn more easy the request permission in Android 8.x or later.

The MobilePermissions component was developed to facilitate the request and granting of permission to the operating system resources that the application needs to use. We seek to make the life of the Delphi Mobile developer simpler.

We translate all the permissions provided for in <i>Project > Options > Application > User Permissions</i> to the component, so the developer will not need to enter the project settings window to mark the permissions he wants to request, just drag a MobilePermissions component to the Form and mark the properties What do you want.

## üíé Categories
The component was divided into 03 (three) distinct categories of permissions represented by properties and sub-properties. Are they:

<ul>
  <li><b>DANGEROUS</b>: The following uses permissions require runtime user approval. </li>
  <li><b>SIGNATURE</b>: The following uses permissions require a matching certificate. </li>
  <li><b>STANDARD</b>: Normal Uses Permissions</li>
</ul>

## üòé Facilities
When using the component, the developer is no longer required to access <i>Project > Options > Application > User Permissiosn</i> because when checking/unchecking the property, the component automatically adjusts the project settings.
